# Welcome!

## Goal:

Develop an ETL routine that reads a CSV or geospatial dataset, limits the results to 10 rows and then uploads it to a CARTO account.

The routine can be created in a .py script or Notebook format such as Jupyter Notebook.

Code efficiency, style and explanation will be evaluated.

## Solution

Please see my Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/summert21/CARTO-skills-test/blob/master/Python-Support-Engineer-Test/Python_Support_Engineer_Test.ipynb)!

Here is my final map!
